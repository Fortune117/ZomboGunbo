What should we define an entity as?
	Every object in a game's scene is an entity (e.g. enemies, bullets, vehicles, etc.)
	Every Entity consists of one or more components which add additional behavior or functionality. Therefore, the behavior of an entity can be changed at runtime by adding or removing components.

So, the entity must be in the scene. So, what properties should all entities have?
	position/velocity
	type/id - basically, something to identify it.
	a way to determine if the entity is valid
	friction/movement/drag/etc - this may be kind of complicated, as we will probably want it to get data from the maps the object is on.
	lighting - we don't need to worry about this for a while, but it is important.
	collisions - might also be difficult. Need to figure out how exactly we want to handle these.
